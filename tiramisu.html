                <p> <strong>Tiramisu</strong> is a classic Italian no-bake dessert made with layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and incredible mascarpone cream.</p>
                <p>The word Tiramisu (tirami su in Italian) means “cheer me up” or “pull me up,” which is very appropriate because one bite will put you in a good mood! An authentic Tiramisu dessert that has 2 main layers: sponge cake ladyfingers soaked in coffee and liqueur and the mascarpone cream layer. This classic dessert often contains raw egg yolks, but we use a different process to create a custard-like cream with amazing texture and flavor.</p>
                <h3><b>INGREDIENTS</b></h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
                    <li>½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided</li>
                    <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1 cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces)</li>
                    <li>1¾ cups good espresso or very strong coffee</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons rum or cognac</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                    <li> About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package)</li>
                    <li>1 to 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p> The above recipe has a yield of 6 to 8 servings. To make this recipe even more delicious we can add <i>Mascarpone</i> which is essentially the Italian version of cream cheese. It is made of whipped cream, stabilized with an acidic ingredient such as lemon juice or citric acid. <i>Mascarpone</i> cheese has a smoother consistency, is milder in flavor and has twice as much fat as cream cheese. </p>

                        <dd>Dip ladyfingers one or two at a time. A quick dip on each side is enough. There will be some syrup left behind.

                    <dt><b>Water Bath</b>
